# IA-8queens
Practical homework of artificial intelligence: problem of 8 queens.

## Q1 - [Genetic Algorithm](./q1-genetic-algorithm/)

1. Create a genetic algorithm for the 8 queens problem seen in class.

## Q2 - [Hill Climb Algorithm](./q2-hill-climb/)

2. Run the hill climb algorithm to solve the 8 queens problem.

### Instructions:

Run the `main.py` file from each project. No dependencies needed.
In each project that is a `README.txt` file with answers from the homework request.

#### Recommendations

This project uses Unicode characters to display emojis, if you are not on UNIX, you may wanna try
running it in a terminal that supports UTF-8 characters.

#### Command Line Arguments

By default, the project will display the homework tasks requested by the teacher. If you wanna see
a "normal" execution in the CLI, use the "`-`" option to run the projects.

Other arguments:

##### Genetic Algorithm

- `-popsize`: size of the population
- `-cols`: number of columns in which the boards ("individuals") will be grouped.
- `-skip`: skips the "in-between" generations output.

##### Hill Climb

- `-skip`: skips the "in-between" states output.
